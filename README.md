# Diamond-Price-Prediction---Machine-Learning
💎 Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting diamond prices based on key attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table.
The goal is to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to generate accurate price predictions and extract actionable business insights.

🎯 Objective

Analyze factors affecting diamond prices

Build and evaluate regression models for price prediction

Support data-driven pricing decisions using insights and visuals

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 15,000+ diamond records with the following features:

Carat – Weight of the diamond

Cut – Quality of the cut

Color – Diamond color grading

Clarity – Measure of diamond purity

Depth & Table – Proportional dimensions
Price – Target variable
